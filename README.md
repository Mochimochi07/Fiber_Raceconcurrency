# Fiber_Raceconcurrency
This is my repo about race conditions in go concurrency using fiber

This is my race condition repo in golang concurrency using fiber.

The race conditions are needed to be put because of disastrous handling when you dont know how many cpu per routine it consumes.

yeah, thats why a waitgroup must be implemented to manage this.

think of it like utorrent.

People know what utorrent is and its a software that downloads very slow but it does handle tons of request.

thats the perfect example for this.

feel free to use it.
